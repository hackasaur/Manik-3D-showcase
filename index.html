            <h1>3D Orc character</h1>
            <p>Created a Orc-like character with complete normal, diffuse, roughness, metallic maps and
                animations using Blender while learning from a character creation course from Udemy. A high poly model
                was sculpted first with high details which was retopologized to a lower poly model for faster rendering,
                next the
                normal/cavity maps were used to add in the details after which the model's color, roughness, metallic
                maps were painted.</p>

            <p>Here is a short video render (cycles 512) for showcasing the orc's animations with sound effects. The
                video was rendered
                on Google cloud using Blender's render in background (headless) functionality</p>

            <h1>3D Fountain pen</h2>
                <p>Created a 3D model of a fountain pen in Blender, added golden text engraving using bump vector node
                    passed as normal and a mix shader node.

            <h1>Chai with samosa and chuttni on a wooden tray</h2>
                <p>Created a 3D model of a glass of chai with a samosa and some chuttni and a tray in Blender, added froth to the
                    liquid using normal and displacement maps. Used depth of field for blurred focus effect and an HDR for the background. Created the glass, plate, tray, chuttni materials using the built-in texture/shader nodes like Glossy shader, and musgrave textures etc.<br>
                    P.S. I love chaiðŸ˜‹

            <h1>Taj Mahal 3D Model</h1>
            <p>Created realistic 3D model of Taj Mahal, scaled accurately to real-life, using Blender. The
                whole model was created in less than a week.</p>

            <h1>3D Cowboy low-poly model fully rigged from scratch, using IK constraints</h2>
                <p>Created a low-poly 3D model of cowboy in Blender also fully rigged, created animations for walk and
                    waving and used path constraints and NLA editor (Non linear animation) to combine the
                    animations and rendered
                    animation on cloud. Here is a short video with sound effects to showcase the animations.
