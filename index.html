            <h1>3D Orc character</h1>
            <p>Created a Orc-like character with complete normal, diffuse (by baking), roughness, metallic maps and
                animations using Blender while learning from a character creation course from Udemy. A high poly model
                was sculpted first with high details which was retopologized to a lower poly model then the
                normal/cavity maps were used to add in the details after which the model's color, roughness, metallic
                maps were painted. The animations were borrowed from mixamo.com for saving time.</p>
            <img class="pictures" src="./media/orc walk.png" alt="orc 3D" style="width:50%;">
            <p>Here is a short video render (cycles 512) for showcasing the orc's animations with sound effects. The
                video was rendered
                on Google cloud using Blender's render in background (headless) functionality</p>

            <h1>Taj Mahal 3D Model</h1>
            <p>Created realistic 3D model of Taj Mahal, scaled accurately to real-life, using Blender. The
                whole model was created in less than a week.</p>
            <img class="pictures" src="./media/taj mahal 128-renders 4k.png" alt="taj mahal" style="width:100%;">
            <p>Here is a video render of the same 3D model. which was also rendered on Google cloud, also added some
                music to it.

            <h1>3D Cowboy low-poly model fully rigged from scratch, using IK constraints</h2>
                <p>Created a low-poly 3D model of cowboy in Blender also fully rigged, created animations for walk and
                    waving and used path constraints and NLA editor (Non linear animation) to make combine the
                    animations and rendered
                    animation on cloud. Here is a short video with sound effects to showcase the animations.
